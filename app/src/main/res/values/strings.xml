         A network of stock exchanges where traders and investors buy and sell shares of publicly-traded companies. \n   \n
                               Private company \n\n
         A company is typically owned by a small number of investors (usually consisting of people like you, your friends or parents, and professional investors) ⇒ large companies can stay private too. \n   \n
       Once the company goes public, you’re opening up that business to be owned by a large number of people. Initial public offering (IPO) is the first time a company sells shares of stock to the public. \n   \n          This means that a company that was privately-owned until then becomes a publicly-traded company \n \n  \n                                           So why go public? \n\n
        Going public raises a lot of cash for a company;
with that money, it becomes easier for a company to grow.\n \n

                                            Why invest? \n\n
         Buying stocks makes the investor (you) partial owner of that business
